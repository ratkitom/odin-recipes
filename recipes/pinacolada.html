        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A traditional piña colada is a blended alcoholic cocktail of 3 parts pineapple juice, 1 part cream of coconut (coconut milk with sugar added), and 1 part white rum. It's typically shaken or blended with ice. Typically you'll see it served in a hurricane glass with a maraschino cherry and pineapple wedge. The drink originated in Puerto Rico and the name piña colada, (in Spanish), literally means "strained pineapple", which is a reference to the freshly pressed and strained pineapple juice used in the drink's preparation. Puerto Rico made it their official drink in 1978!</p>
